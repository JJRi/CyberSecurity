**Internet of stuff:**

Never do this again from the get go. Do a real writeup in the future, but because 1st times memo is lost and you didn't 2nd time which was frustrating, as a reminder 11001 is the random generator client and 11002 is the server that needs the connection. The traffic is TLS secure.

Never f√∂rket.
