# CyberSecurity

I'm learning cybersecurity and here's my personal memo and some mixed files about the topic. This is just for me to keep up what I have learned and done **outside my formal studies** at JAMK. Also here are notes of what needs to be done next.

**Goals of Autum 2022:**

* Be in top 15 of Finland on TryHackme
 
* * You started to put down memos about rooms you do, it was a good idea.

* Do three Nixu challenges (1st: PEasy, 2nd: , 3rd: )

* Continue and finish the HackADay-U course

**Goals of Summer 2022:**

Do Hackaday-U reverse engineering class.

Do Jr. Penetration tester path @ THM. ----- **Done**

**Goals of Spring 2022:**

Be in top 100 of all time score on Nixu challenge - **Done**
