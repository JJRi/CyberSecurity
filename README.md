# CyberSecurity

I'm learning cybersecurity and here's my personal memo and some mixed files about the topic. This is just for me to keep up what I have learned and done **outside my formal studies** at JAMK. Also here are notes of what needs to be done next.

**Goals of Summer 2022:**

Do Hackaday-U reverse engineering class.

Do Jr. Penetration tester path @ THM.

**Goals of Spring 2022:**

Be in top 100 of all time score on Nixu challenge - **Done**

Be in top 50 of Finland on TryHackme - **Done**

# Something completely different

### OverTheWire

Bandit challenge done up to the level 21. Did this as a part of Linux course in JAMK. Do more challenges/paths to re-enforce learning after THM paths are done.
